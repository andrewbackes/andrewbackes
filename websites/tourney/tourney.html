					I want people other than myself and close friends to try out this software. The goals of the site pivots around distribution and support. In the near future, I am planning to add documentation on how to use Tourney, with screenshots and directions for all of its features. I will also be adding bug reporting and a user wish list.

					<h2>Project Started</h2>

					<p>
					Over the course of working on my chess engine, I primarily used Arena 3.0 and ChessGUI to test and tune. While they provided a lot of features that I enjoyed, I constantly found myself wanting more. Particularly:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Less overhead for running a chess game. One second games should take one second.</li>
						<li>More than one computer should be able to participate in the tournament. Some tournaments can take several weeks or months on a single computer (as is the case with some tuning techniques). What about friends and family who have computers idling all day while they are at work? Think Prime95 but for chess tournaments!</li>
						<li>Anybody should be able to watch the tournament from anywhere. By using a web interface to broadcasting games, progress of the tournament can be checked on any OS (including phones and tablets) from any location without special software.</li>
						<li>Data should be easy to view. For long tournaments, finding engine output for a particular move of a particular game can be time consuming, even daunting. Instead, all of the tournament data (results, engine logs, trends, etc.) should be cross referenced.</li>
					</ul>
