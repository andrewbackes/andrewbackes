				<p>
				In anticipation of releasing the first version of Dirty-Bit soon, I decided to create a dedicated website. The primary purpose of the site is to distribute the release and subsequent releases there after. I hope to get a bug reporting form up shortly after the release so that anybody nice enough to help test my program can have an easy way to get back to me with any problems that they find.
				</p>
				<p>
				So far, all of my project goals and milestones have been recorded in a plain text document that I keep with the source code. As an alternative purpose for the site, I thought it would be nice to have another place to share all of that. Throughout this project I have consulted many blogs, wikis, forumn posts, and even logs from other chess engines to help me learn about what technologies are out there. If I ever get enough down time, I would like to contribute back to the community by sharing some of my experiences with those that may be just getting started.
				</p>
				<p>
				Lastly, programming in general is a fun experience for me. This website is just another excuse. Plus I need to freshen up on my css, php and javascript. I have considered trying to implement a web front end for Dirty-Bit, but that is a sizable project in its own right and we will have to see what ends up happening down the road.

				The initial project goals are fairly straightforward:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Create a program that plays legal chess.</li>
					<li>Have the program use bitmaps as an internal board representation.</li>
					<li>Utilize the Universal Chess Interface protocol.</li>
					<li>Outperform my previously written chess programs.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
				This is to be an ongoing project that will hopefully last several years. The immediate and long term goals are dynamic and change after each milestone. Check the <a href="about.html">About page</a> for more information.
				</p>
				<p>
				This program has a brother program, in the sense that it was started on the same day by my closest friend, <a href="http://math.berkeley.edu/~sparks/">Daniel Sparks</a>. His program is called <a href="http://math.berkeley.edu/~sparks/exacto/">Exacto</a> and you can find it <a href="http://math.berkeley.edu/~sparks/exacto/">here</a>.
